# Overview
RSMP 4 is for monitoring and controlling roadside equipment.

It builds on the experiences of RSMP 3 to create an even more flexible and robust protocol.

RSMP 4 is build on MQTT 4, which solves a lot of the hard issues related to message deliver, acknowledgement and buffering, so RSMP can focus on what's specific to roadside equipment and supervisor systems.
