# RSMP 4 Draft Specification
The Work on the RSMP 4 draft specification is mandated by the RMSP Steering Group, and described in the [Activty Plan](
https://rsmp-nordic.org/plan/#draft-for-core-specification-40-ongoing). Once a draft specification is ready, the RSMP 4 Working Group will provide a recommendatition to the Steering Group about whether RSMP 4 should become an official specification, or we should stay with RSMP 3 for now.

View [existing specifications](https://rsmp-nordic.org/specification/), including RMSP 3.

For general info about RSMP, please see the [RSMP Nordic website](https://rsmp-nordic-org).
