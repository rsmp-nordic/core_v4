# RSMP 4 Draft Specification
Draft specification for RSMP 4, expected to be build on top of the MQTT protocol.

Note that there is no official decisions about RMSP 4 yet. Work is mandated by the RMSP Steering Group, and described in the [Activty Plan](
https://rsmp-nordic.org/plan/#draft-for-core-specification-40-ongoing). Once a draft specification is ready, we will provide a recommendatition to the steering group about whether RSMP 4 should become an official specification.
